# Advent of Code Solutions

## Overview
Welcome to the **Advent of Code Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to the annual **Advent of Code** programming challenge. Each year, the challenge provides a series of coding puzzles from December 1st to December 25th, with each puzzle increasing in difficulty. This repository currently holds solutions for **Advent of Code 2024**, with plans to include future years as I continue participating.

The solutions are written in **Go** (Golang), and each folder corresponds to a specific day's challenge, making it easy to navigate between different puzzles and see my approach for each problem.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure for this repository is organized as follows:

```
advent-of-code/
├── 2024/                    # Solutions for Advent of Code 2024
│   ├── day01/               # Solution for Day 1
│   ├── day02/               # Solution for Day 2
│   └── dayX/                # Solution for Day X
```

As the repository grows, I will add solutions for future years, and each year will have its own top-level folder (e.g., `2024`, `2025`).

## Features
- **Modular Solutions**: Each day's challenge is solved in a separate folder, with a dedicated Go file for each task.
- **Clean Code**: Solutions are written with readability in mind and are well-commented to explain the thought process.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Focus on optimizing solutions to handle both small and large inputs efficiently.
- **Daily Progress**: As new puzzles are released each day, I add my solution for that day's challenge to the corresponding folder.

## Getting Started
To run the solutions locally, you will need to have **Go** installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Install Go**: Follow the installation instructions on the official Go website: [Go Installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code.git
    ```
3. **Navigate to the Year Folder**: Each year's puzzles are stored in separate folders. For example, to work with the 2024 puzzles:
    ```bash
    cd advent-of-code/2024
    ```
4. **Run a Solution**: Each day’s solution is contained in a Go file. For example, to run the solution for Day 1:
    ```bash
    go run day01/main.go
    ```
